# Installation
Love2D is required (Newer versions DO NOT work. Love 0.9.0 has been tested, works, and is on the Love2D website). Get it here <https://love2d.org/>. If you're on windows, simply drag the source folder to the Love2D executable.

This repository is now archived. I created this program in middle school for my geometry class. It was one of my earliest projects, and I am glad it has lasted till today.
